            <div className="container">
            <p> In the Philippines, majority of the farmers belong to the low-income className. Thus, the conventional supply chain of fresh produce in the Philippines can be expressed as follows: farm-to-middleman-to-second-middleman-to-third-middleman-to-fourth-middleman-to-fifth-middleman-to-table. Thereâ€™s extra cost that goes for each middle-man who in turn just drive up the prices of the agricultural crops in the market. With recent events of importation of several produce from neighboring countries, most of the Filipinos favor the low-priced imported goods over the local crops of our farmers. A Farmers' Hub (FH) is a one-stop commercial service platform where smallholders can access quality agri-inputs, farm machinery, markets, finance, and knowledge.

                        <hr/>
                        <p>Helps the farmers/agricultural producers minimize,if not fully eliminated, the negative effects of middlemen by creating an online marketplace where they can showcase their produce to direct consumers. This marketplace will help promote local farm communities and at the same time provide an ease of access for consumers to buy fresh and healthy products at a competitive price.
